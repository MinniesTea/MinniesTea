### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught developer, and recent graduate, with a strong foundation in software programming concepts. I have experience using Java, Python and HTML/CSS.

My motivation for choosing a career in software development, and changing from photography, comes from a university project. I had to create a website to display my portfolio, and I learned the syntax of HTML, CSS, JavaScript to complete this. During this time, I realised how I can transform ideas to a working application, leading to a real positive benefit on the community around me. This drives me to produce the best work I can using the best practices.

During the past year I have consolidated my foundation by creating projects and attending bootcamps. I used Java to create many backend projects such as taking in user input via a RESTful API and storing this data in a SQL database. In this project I also changed architectures from a monolithic to microservices architecture to ensure future flexibility when I want to change the front end client from Thymeleaf to React/Angular. I also created my own coding portoflio website using Bootsrtap, HTML/CSS and Netlify to host my website. 

These projects along with my university project means I now have a strong awareness of the difference between front end development and backend development, and how they interact.

Last year I attended a Data Skills Bootcamp in which I looked at SQL and database handling. In addition to this I also performed advanced SQL query calculations on existing data as well as inserted, deleted, and updated data from the database. Using SQL Join methods, I combined multiple database tables for analysis. With the collected data I also learnt how to create reports and how to communicate this data by utilizing spreadsheets and dashboards to present information in a meaningful manner. 

I am currently a participant in a Data Academy Bootcamp learning Python fundamentals, including key data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciKit, and Tensorflow. In addition to this I am gaining a solid grounding in machine learning algorithms, relational database management (SQL), data visualisation/business intelligence packages such as Tableau, PowerBi, and R programming language.

I am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting to further develop and consolidate my knowledge.
