### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught developer, and recent graduate, with a strong foundation in software programming concepts. I am self-taught in Java, HTML/CSS, JS & React, and I recently completed Tech Talent Academyâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp learning Python, including key data science libraries. In addition to this I have also completed Baltic Apprenticeships Data Accelerator Bootcamp looking at the fundamentals of SQL and databases. 

My motivation for choosing a career in software development, and changing from photography, comes from a university project. I had to create a website to display my portfolio, and I learned the syntax of HTML, CSS, JavaScript to complete this. During this time, I realised how I can transform ideas to a working application, leading to a real positive benefit on the community around me. This drives me to produce the best work I can using the best practices.

During the past year I have consolidated my foundation by creating projects, attending bootcamps and continuing on with my self learning. These experences along with my university project means I now have a strong awareness of the difference between front end development and backend development, and how they interact.

I am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting to further develop and consolidate my knowledge.

Take a peak at some of my projects below!ðŸ˜Š
