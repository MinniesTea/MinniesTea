### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught Java developer, and recent graduate, with a strong foundation in software programming concepts.

My motivation for choosing a career in software development, and changing from photography, comes from a university project. I had to create a website to display my portfolio, and I learned the syntax of HTML, CSS, JavaScript to complete this. During this time, I realised how I can transform ideas to a working application, leading to a real positive benefit on the community around me. This drives me to produce the best work I can using the best practices.

During the past year I have consolidated my foundation by creating projects. I used Java to create many backend projects such as taking in user input via a RESTful API and storing this data is a SQL database. These projects along with my university project means I now have a strong awareness of the difference between front end development and backend development, and how they interact.

I am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting to further develop and consolidate my knowledge.
