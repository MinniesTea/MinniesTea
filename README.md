### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a hardworking self-taught developer, and graduate, with a strong foundation in software programming concepts. 

During the past year I have consolidated my foundation by creating projects, attending boot camps and continuing on with my self learning. Creating a working program from scratch using only knowledge and initiative really drives me to produce the best work I can. Some of these projects are highlighted below. These experiences mean I now have a strong awareness of the difference between front end development and backend development, and how they interact.

I am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting to further develop and consolidate my knowledge.

Take a peak at some of my projects below! There are pictures!ðŸ˜Š
